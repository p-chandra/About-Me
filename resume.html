      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I don't enjoy working at a desk, nor am I deeply passionate about programming—even though I'm okay at it. I competed in a couple of programming competitions in college and started many projects and applications, most of which were never finished—either because I got bored or just forgot about them.</p> 
      <br>
      <p>What I do enjoy are puzzles or puzzles-like games, whether it's NYT Games like Wordle, Strands, or Crosswords, or puzzles found in video games and escape rooms or just math proofs. There's something exciting about finding creative ways to solve problems and the rush you get when your solution actually works. That's why I find cybersecurity to be an interesting field. Games like CTFs or challenges on HackTheBox all are puzzles.</p> 
      <br>
      <p>I also enjoy doing DIY projects and various forms of arts and crafts, such as painting and design. This is part of why I somewhat enjoyed software engineering in college. Just like how you can build a table with basic tools, planning, and materials, you can also create a Discord bot that displays embarrassing photos of your friends—using the tools within a computer.</p> 
      <br>
      <p>Lastly, I want to mention that I really enjoy learning new things in general. I'm naturally curious, but just like my projects, I have a tendency to jump between hobbies. There are many things I've dabbled in but never fully committed to—like golfing, fishing, snowboarding, crafting, pickleball, tennis, gardening, bouldering, working on cars, and hiking.</p>
