      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I don't really enjoy working at a desk or am I really passionate about programming even though I'm okay at it. I competed in couple programming competitions in college and started many projects and applications that never got done because I got bored or just simply forgot about it. 
        <br><br><br>
        Things that I do like are puzzle like games weather its NYT Games such as Wordle, Strands, Crosswords, or puzzles in video games and escape rooms. There is something exciting about finding creative ways to solve problems and the rush you get when the solution actually works. Thats why I find Cyber Security to be an interesting field. Games like CTFs or challenges from HackTheBox are all puzzles. 
        <br><br><br>
        I also enjoy working on small scale DIY and artsy/decorative projects. This is why I somewhat enjoyed software engineering in college. Just like how you can create a table with some basic tools and planning and paint your initials on it, you can create a discord bot that displays embarrassing photos of your friends in the server.
        <br><br><br>
        Lastly, I want to mention I really enjoy learning. I am very curious by nature which I found out in the industry to be a double-edged sword. Without proper mentorship and guidance, I will be in a rabbit hole for hours searching things that may or may not be related to the task at hand.
